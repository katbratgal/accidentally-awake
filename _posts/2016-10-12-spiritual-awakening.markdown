**Spirituality. Kundalini. Meditation. Oneness. Intuition. Premonitions. Inner knowing. Ego. Spirit. Consciousness.**

These words were not a part of my everyday vocabulary two months ago. To be honest, I wasn't sure what a premonition was exactly, I had no idea consciousness had another meaning, and I sure as heck didn't know what a Kundalini was. My life sounded more like this:

**Jesus. Bible. Diaper change. Electric bill. Mac and cheese. Naptime. Ugh-we're-out-of-milk-again.**
<!--more-->

Spiritual awakening, ascension, enlightenment--yeah, those words never made an impact in my life at all. That's what people in the East achieved in their spiritual communities...

...while meditating on the side of an mountain...

That doesn't happen to Western stay-at-home moms. Right?

(*laughs manically*)

Wrong.

Enlightened sounds like such a loaded term for what I am, so I'll put that word aside. But awake? Yes, I'm awake. *Accidentally* awake. Yet still, very much awake.

And this, dear reader, is what an awakening is like.

I was, at first, hesitant to the inner nagging that wanted me to make a blog about my awakening. "For what purpose would it serve?" my panicking ego asked. I have no idea, but I'm learning that's what waking up is. It's surrender. It's healing. It's stepping out of your comfort zone. It's becoming who you are supposed to be. It's more than knowing. It's being.

I'm not a master, guru, guide, or teacher. I still consider myself straddling the two worlds of consciousness and sleeping. Maybe, this is where I am supposed to be, only fifty yards ahead of those just waking instead of a 1000. It's much easier to yell back, "It's ok! It's safe to keep moving forward!" Maybe my words will make an impact on the five people who actually read this blog. I may never know for sure what purpose this blog will achieve. But I'll write anyway. Because as you wake up, you learn the less you resist your intuition, the better. I'll be explaining more about that coming up...

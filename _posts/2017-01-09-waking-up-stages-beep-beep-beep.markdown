BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's the sound of your incorporeal alarm clock telling you--in the *nicest* way possible--to wake the hell up. This stage is one of the hardest to get through. You must be compassionate to yourself, because it won't feel like the universe is doing you the same favor. The obnoxious beeping continues on until it's satisfied that you aren't going back to sleep. This is the sound of being ripped from unconsciousness to awareness, and it's intensity can knock you to the ground. This is your alarm clock telling you your life is a lie. It's the catalyst that triggers the biggest changes you will ever face.

*Not everyone goes through stages or these stages in this order. Some may not find the process divided into steps. And others may skip stages. Waking up is personal and unique. These stages are about what I went through, and how I coped. Many symptoms and emotions eclipsed several stages, and I am generally speaking of when such events began. Symptoms may have started or will start at different stages for you. The transition between stages can be gentle and prolonged or can be sudden and remarkable.*

### What life is like

Spiritual awakenings can be set in motion by a profound life experience--a near-death experience, illness, death of someone close, divorce, separation, or betrayal. This list is not exhaustive, and there are other events that might shake someone awake. Not every sudden, profound, or bad experience is the catalyst to an awakening, however, but often it takes turning someone's world upside down for them to see their life in a new perspective. What triggers the transition from sleep to consciousness involves an unavoidable challenge to deeply cemented beliefs. It could mean losing something precious and valuable, something the newly-awakened has based their life on, like a religion, a codependent relationship, a career, their health, and so on.

While catalysts, with all due respect, suck, they are the defining moment in a person's life, the moment that everything changes. A new, previously unforeseen path offers a detour around the wreckage of the catalyst and leads to somewhere peaceful and unexpected. Eventually, the memory of the event will become less painful, and if the "victim" is accepting of the awakening, grief will be replaced with gratitude. But for the time being, the catalyst, this alarm clock, will feel anything but loving.

### Prominent feelings and emotions

- grief

- anger

- shame

- confusion

- feeling betrayed (by God, the universe, belief systems, or people involved in the catalyst)

### Symptoms

- Loss of sleep: Grieving disrupts sleep, and the strong emotions that occur upon waking will be intense enough to wake you up at night and affect your dreams.

- Mental fog: The overload of emotions can rob you of functioning normally in day to day tasks.

- Irritability/Bouts of rage: You didn't ask for this to happen to you, so it's fair that you're angry. The catalyst is painful, and it would be hard to deny its existence. It forces changes on you that you are not ready for (that's why I call this site *accidentally* awake).

### Self-care during this stage

Getting sleep, embracing emotions, and focusing on your needs are the most important ways to remain centered. The subconscious is beginning to process the triggering event. Dreams and nightmares will change their themes and may become distressing. Stay in contact with trustworthy and encouraging people during this time. Therapy is a good resource for organizing confusing thoughts and coping with strong emotions.

### Stuck in the catalyst stage?

Fortunately, this stage will pass as the shock of the sudden change of events wears off. The newly awake begins to get in touch with their feelings, and a new phase begins. The beeping of the alarm is still loud and strong, but through groggy, blurry eyes, you begin to see reality through a new lens. During this phase, you have a choice to make--wake up or try go back to sleep.

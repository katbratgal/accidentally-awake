For one minute, everything made sense. Nothing in this world seemed worth worrying about. Death couldn't even make me fear its power. There was no more sorrow, and no more pain. No sickness, no frustration. After that minute, *it* left. I wasn't having a near-death experience. I wasn't deep in meditation. I wasn't praying or bent into a yoga pose. To be honest, I was looking in the mirror, getting ready for my day, when *it* hit.

I miss that glimpse of peace--that moment when I never felt more connected to the source of all creation. I can barely scrape together the words to describe how time and space revealed themselves to be the illusions they are... How I felt accepted and a part of a macrocosmic synchronization... How, for that minute, everything was...ok.

It was peace, more overwhelming than anything I had ever experienced before. When I gently came back to reality, I accepted life would never be the same again. A new kind of *awareness* was taking effect in my life. Soon after, I found out that I had been going through an awakening for over two years before that moment.

The hard part of this journey is knowing something that good, that kind of love and peace, is waiting for me, for us. And I can't have that back. Not now.

Though I tried to get it back...

If you've experienced that level of peace, you've probably struggled to have it back in your life, too. You may have meditated and rushed through healing just to be embraced by that light again. But this is how we get stuck from moving forward. Like an addict chasing that first high, we, too, can become addicted to recreating those amazing, soaring feelings.

Sucks majorly, doesn't it? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't depressed or irritated when I couldn't have the peace again. Earth seems so chaotic, driven by anxiety and selfishness, shallow, and...asleep. It's jarring realizing how we fill up our lives with insignificant junk that has no real meaning. Pursing peace seemed worthwhile, but like those behaviors and things we as humanity do to keep ourselves asleep, it was just another escape.

I quickly learned that peace is not the destination. It's a side effect, it's a benefit, but it's sure not the end-all. Blame it on Earth. We Earth-dwellers have these needs for goals. We are always working toward something, and we are always going somewhere, trying to find that sweet spot that affords us all the serenity and luxuries we've been searching for.

Peace is not the ultimate obtainment for me, for you, for Earth. Relaxing in this idea gives me strength to face the hardest parts of processing and healing. I feel better going through the waxing and waning of my emotional state as I'm going through this awakening. Bad feelings are not bad. They just...are. Peace doesn't mean I'm headed in the right direction. It's just what...is. Knowing and allowing this new me to be molded and shaped is a lot less stressful. Smaller bits of peace come and go, grow stronger, stay longer, as long as I surrender to the stress, the pain, and the rehabilitation of my life.

I don't need that extraordinary level of peace anymore. I'm ok letting it go to deal with the taxing restoration of my life. The flow of tragedy and harmony is dynamic, and I can live with those ups and downs without trying to control them. Peace will come without me trying to wrangle it back. Surrendering that control...that's a beautiful kind of peace all of its own.

We did it! We reached the end of this god awful (yet very cool) process! Only...what's up with these symptoms still sticking around? Why, as a mature, enlightened being, am I still having moments of anger? I mean, I didn't really mean to call the guy who cut me off on the freeway a sackless, monkey-brained moron. I love that guy. REALLY! But why am I frustrated around people? I'm supposed to be a loving being, a goddamn Jesus of our times! I'm supposed to be surrounded by peace, love, and angels. What the hell is going wrong?

In one word--nothing. It's when you accept that there is no end to this process, that there is no way of worming out of living the human experience, it means one thing: you've reached the *end*. And this is what this end means to me.

"Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."

There is a reason why this piece of wisdom exists. My life continues in a changed and unchanged way. And here's the key word of that sentence: it *continues*. I don't live in a state of bliss and peace all the time, nor do I find it necessary. I feel a deep love and compassion for all human beings, yet I will still get annoyed with anyone for any reason. Even downright raging. I'm not immune to emotions; I am happy, excited, angry, bitter, confused, nervous, and sad. Because I am human, living a human experience. No emotions are bad, and none are worth escaping from.

I am not wise. Humility better suits me. I am a student and will be forever. I don't have all the answers. Just a few that I don't even fully understand. I have something to learn from others, I have something to learn as I go through life events. I want to experience those events, even if I know I don't have to.

My ego isn't dead. I see no point killing it. There is no benefit nor harm to its demise, so I would rather be its friend. Many are caught up in this "bad, ego! bad!" mentality. I went through that before deciding I was running away from the pettiness, the pain, the never-ending desires of the ego. Now, I would rather embrace them, experience them, and learn from them. Denying my ego would be denying a part of myself, as if it's a problem to be rid of. No, it's fine. My ego is what it needs to be. It's perfect.

I fully accept my humanness, and I fully accept that ingrained in me is the source of creation. I can choose what perspective to see the world (either from the lens of the ego or through a higher perspective), though my awakening will always be a part of me. I know that I'm on a journey with no end, no goal, and no reward. I don't need enlightenment. I don't need spirituality. I don't need beliefs. Heck, I don't even need oneness.

I'm sorry to say that the *end* is another ego pursuit. As I went through this process, I began to drop beliefs of what I *should* be as an awakened person. And now that I have reached the point of acceptance that everything is perfect, I don't need healing, I don't need to be more loving, I don't need be at peace. All I can say to my ego's need to live by the warm and fluffy spiritual rules is...

Fuck. That. Shit.

Friend, if that offends you and you are on a spiritual journey, I invite you to sit with that feeling and that thought. What is the end of this process to you? What do you see yourself becoming? Who wrote those rules of how you are supposed to be?

Enlightenment may just be setting fire to the rules. All rules. Even those that dictate that you must be in peace, love, wisdom, and stillness.

Because, *that* is freedom. And that is what waking up is.

The end, that point where you're sipping your coffee and are now fully awake, when does that happen? At night? No, it happens in the morning, when there is still much to do and a life to live. Ready to live? Then, live. Now. In this moment. Now is the only thing you have to claim. So, claim it. Do whatever you need to do now. Because you are free.

And now you know.

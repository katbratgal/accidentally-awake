Congratulations! You're awake. Eh, barely. So you're still fumbling with the alarm clock to get it to shut up. Your eyelids are heavy, your vision is blurry, but you're up, and there is no going back to sleep now. You notice the room around you has changed. Heck, the whole world has changed, and only you seem to notice the difference. A shift in your awareness has occurred, and you are now realizing something bigger than yourself has control of your life.

*Not everyone goes through stages or these stages in this order. Some may not find the process divided into steps. And others may skip stages. Waking up is personal and unique. These stages are about what I went through, and how I coped. Many symptoms and emotions eclipsed several stages, and I am generally speaking of when such events began. Symptoms may have started or will start at different stages for you. The transition between stages can be gentle and prolonged or can be sudden and remarkable.*

### What life is like

If you don't notice it first, someone will point out to you that you are changing. This personality shift can be both beautiful and frustrating. It's beautiful, because you are starting see what love really is. It's frustrating, because toxic people will try to sabotage your transformation for their own selfish purposes. They don't want you to heal; it's not in their best interests.

You begin to break away from behaviors that don't serve you anymore. You're discerning between what is loving and what is harm. Purging these harmful practices stirs up a lot of rage and shame that needs to be felt in order to be released. This is when you have to create boundaries and safe spaces in order to process the past pains and traumas.

This stage is especially about relationships. Some bonds will strengthen while others will break. Friends and family will either encourage the new you or try to destroy you. Trusting your intuition is vital as it gently guides you in freeing yourself from toxic, abusive, or codependent relationships. If you don't know how to listen to your inner voice, don't worry, it will teach you how to listen. Its messages will be stronger, louder, and impossible not to notice.

While your world transforms on the outside, your inner world is imploding and rebuilding itself, too. The labels you used to describe yourself before may change drastically. You recognize yourself as a being to be loved. You realize you are worthy of protection and kindness. Resistance to this change can result in vivid nightmares, mood swings, achiness, and exhaustion.

Though this stage is hard, lonely, and painful both physically and mentally, you adapt. As you begin to surrender to the process, you start to understand what peace and freedom are. The more you understand, the more you are willing to purge the darkness to allow light in.

### Prominent feelings and emotions

- anger

- anxiety

- relief

- shame

- hope

- peace

### Symptoms

- Physical changes: Your body is reacting to the processing and healing you are doing. Your weight could change dramatically. Aches, joint pain, headaches, and flu-like symptoms come and go. Extreme fatigue is a common symptom, and you can have it regardless of how much you slept the night before. As always, seek the opinion of a medical professional first before writing off symptoms as part of a awakening.

- Isolation and apathy: You're prioritizing your life, and activities that once enticed you, now have little to no meaning. You're no longer interested in superficial pursuits, and thus are less interested in superficial connection with others. Awakenings are lonely journeys. No one understands what you're going through unless they've been there themselves. You're becoming indifferent to the worries and desires of this world. Other people's anxieties overwhelm you. You're sensitive to too much stimulation and negative moods. You seek out quiet places to be on your own more than ever.

- Intuitive abilities: No, you are not crazy. But you are psychic. (We all are, but now, you'll be overwhelmed with so many messages, it will be very difficult for you to deny you have abilities.) If you were never into psychic phenomenon before, you are now. All kinds of messages come into your life, from strong feelings to intrusive voices, from visions to precognitive dreams. You might feel like someone is trying to contact you either through thoughts, images, voices, numbers, animals, and very vivid dreams. You may even experience astral projection and find yourself engaging with guides, deceased family members, and not-so friendly spirits. (Until you know for sure who can be trusted, please do not actively speak with strangers on the other side, not until you know what you are doing. Entities can't physically hurt you, but they can make your life miserable. Just like on Earth, set appropriate boundaries with anyone you meet.)

### Self-care during this stage

Taking care of yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually is your first priority. Transforming is exhausting and requires rest. Strong emotions will surface. Don't avoid these big and scary feelings. Releasing them requires recognizing the hurt. Find a safe place to express your emotions and connect to trustworthy people to help you through the grieving. If certain foods feel toxic to you, avoid them for the time being.

### Stuck in the battle to keep your eyes open?

You can't go back to where you were knowing what you know now. Yet, moving forward seems like an impossible uphill battle. The way to keep moving, the way to open your eyes fully, is to have faith in the awakening process. It means surrendering and letting those big emotions be felt. It's accepting the changes coming your way and having the courage to take another step forward. This stage is tough. It's the hardest (and possibly the longest) stage to get through. But you will get through it.

In the next stage, you're climbing out of bed, stumbling toward the coffee maker, but your legs feel different. Walking on these heavy, tingling legs might feel like learning how to walk again after a traumatic accident. You're still uncertain about your new life and your new abilities, and you're testing how much weight your legs hold. The next stage is all about rehabilitation. And it's my, personally, favorite stage in the process.

The most frustrating thing about [writing a blog](https://accidentally-awake.com/2016-10/spiritual-awakening) on spiritual awareness is how limited I would be using the second-person point of view. That is, speaking directly to you, the reader, rather than rambling on in first-person like a narc. To be honest, these "I"s I use so often in this blog have me in knots. I'm not a "look at me!" kind of person. Putting my story on here hasn't been easy. But that's what awakenings do. They make you do things that you would never do before.

While this blog does serve a purpose in healing my social anxiety, there is a bigger reason why I write so personally.

Waking up has not been a walk in the park for me. (Key words: **FOR ME**.) I've heard stories of others who fared just fine. Quite a few lost their sense of self immediately. Though my ego has been taken down a few notches, it's held on for dear life. Some had a holy experience and continued in their belief systems. I lost religion completely. In other people's lives, barely anything changed at all. But for some like me, everything changed. And there are those who have entered a state where they no longer needed a purpose in this life. I have no idea if I just hadn't entered this state yet, but that *truth* feels like death to my soul.

None of these paths are more right, more wrong, more enlightened, or more undeveloped. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I seriously doubt anyone wakes up the "right way." It's a beautiful and unique experience. My culture, my upbringing, my religion, my beliefs, my age, and my gender makes me different from you. My own mystical transformation was tailored just for me. I can't tell you how to wake up; that would be useless. I have my truths. You have yours. I have my inner knowing for what is right for me. You know what is right for you.

I've always despised "should"s. Now, I downright hate them. What especially makes me cranky is hearing the awake *shoulding* people. No! No more shoulds! What is true and right for me isn't necessarily the same for you. If I were to preach on how to awaken right, I'd be trapping you in another dark box, imprisoning you from the light.

Why do I bother writing about my awakening at all? Because somewhere along your travels, your path will intersect with mine. Our paths may merge for a while before yours deviates on its own course. Or we might start from the same point. Awakenings can be hard. Awakenings are, for many, lonely journeys. You may be the only person you know that has experienced this phenomenon. Instead of telling you how to walk or nudging you along this path, I'd rather show you that it's going to be alright. Our roads may be different, but they will all lead to the same place. We have different walks, and different truths.

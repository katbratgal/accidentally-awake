It was the biggest prayer of my life. I wanted to believe in a God who could not be contained in 66 books. I wanted to believe in unconditional love and forgiveness. I wanted to emulate that God, because I wanted to believe peace was in the surrender of selfishness.

After my prayer in [My Last Prayer as a Christian Part 1](/2016-10/my-last-prayer-as-a-christian-part-1), I put away researching theology for a few days. There were no more questions that needed answers. I had no yearning for truth; I was relaxing in my faith. But one night, one last question surfaced and refused to be ignored.

Grudgingly, I got out the laptop. With a groan, I opened up a browser. It was a tough question to search for, but I did my best translating into the search engine the question now searing in my mind.

*Was Jesus trying to tell his followers that we should worry about the heaven and hell found here on Earth, not so much in the afterlife?*

I clicked around many Christian-based sites, finding very few articles that supported my theory. One site on the search results list pulled me in, and I clicked. Honestly, I can't remember the site or how to get there now. I frowned as I read, not quite understanding what the site was about, yet this particular page was describing my exact feelings about heaven and hell. I poked around the site more, in awe of this feeling that had come over me. For the first time in my life, I knew I was reading the truth--the truth about life, God, everything.

I read until my eyes were closing and my head was falling onto my keyboard. I went to sleep and had an ordinary night of rest. Next morning, I couldn't forget the words that I read the night before. They haunted me, burning brightly in my mind's eye as I got through coffee, breakfast, and a shower. I dressed; they were still there.

Staring in the mirror that morning, it all made sense. I was at peace. I reconciled with the truth I had known all along--we are all going to be ok. We are all loved with a kind of compassion that cannot be found on this planet. There was no reason to fear anything at all.

After that minute of enlightenment, I was no longer a Christian. I didn't need belief systems anymore. My prayer was being answered, and that's all I needed to believe in. My transformation of my new identity was complete. With a smile, I wrote "return to sender" on my gift of salvation. I'm grateful that I was pressured into this Christ-centered religion, because it had its purpose for the right stretch of time in my life.

It never ceased to amaze me how my prayers were answered before. It would always be in a way I had never expected. How ironic that my prayer to be a better Christian would involve me losing my religion completely.

I wrote this post for those who ended up following the same path. Not all who wake up walk away from religion. Some become mystics in their faith tradition. Some embrace all paths to God. Some find a new religion. Some take up spiritual practices or find their beliefs tied with spirituality.

For me, it was a graduation from Christianity to recognizing the beauty of truths across many religions (thought I resist the constraints those religions place on their followers). It was opening up to spirituality, but not losing myself in New Age philosophies.

Life has changed now that my God is (literally) love. There is no such thing as hell, unless I create it. I can embrace heaven by my own will. I knew this deep within me, ever since I was kid first exposed to doctrine. God is too loving to separate us upon death. Whatever separation we have now is our own doing. We either remain in pain or we awake to the light--two paths. We either walk through the narrow gate, or we take the wide path that leads to sorrow.

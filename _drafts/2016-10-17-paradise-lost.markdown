For one minute, everything made sense. There were no more fears; death couldn't even touch me. There was no more sorrow, and no more pain. No sickness, no frustration. After that minute, it left. I wasn't having a near-death experience, nor was I deep in meditation. I wasn't praying or bent into a yoga pose. To be honest, I was looking in the mirror, getting ready for my day, when it hit.

I miss that glimpse of peace--that moment when I never felt more connected to love. I'm a writer, and even I can barely scrape together the proper words to describe how time and space revealed themselves to be the illusions they were. How I felt accepted and apart of something that worked together in perfect synchoronization (see, having trouble making sense here). How for that minute, everything was...ok.

It was peace, more overwhelming than anything I had ever experienced before. I felt so completly vulnerable as I felt the Universe open up, but at the same time, it was fine for me to feel that stripped of everything I thought I knew about life. While I gently came back to reality, I knew life would never be the same again. A new level of consciousness was taking effect, and it was soon after that I found out that I had been going through an awakening for over two years before that moment.

The hard part of knowing something that good--that love and peace--is waiting for us is knowing that I can't have right now. And it would stupid to try to get it back.

Yeah, I know, dear reader. If you've experienced that peace, too, you've probably have been clamoring to have it back in your life. You may meditated and rushed through healing just to be embraced by that light again. But this is how we get stuck from moving forward in our journeys. Like an addict chasing that first high, we, too, can become addicted to recreating those amazing, soaring feelings.

Sucks majorly, doesn't it? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't depressed or irritated when I couldn't get it back. I quickly (fortunately) learned that peace is not the destination. It's a side effect, it's a benefit, but it's sure not the end-all. Blame it on Earth. We Earth-dwellers have these needs for goals. We are always working toward one, and are always going somewhere, trying to find that sweet spot that affords us all the peace and luxuries we've been searching for.

Kinda crazy, right? I'm still trying to wrap my head around this concept: peace is not the ultamite obtainment for me, for you, for Earth. Relaxing in this idea gives me strength to face the hardest parts of processing and healing. I feel better going through the waxing and waning of my emotional state as I'm going through this awakening. Knowing and allowing this new me to be molded and shaped is a lot less stressful. Smaller bits of peace come and go, grow stronger, stay longer as long as I surrdender to the stress, the pain, and the rehabilitation of my life.

I don't need that extraordinary level of peace anymore. I'm ok letting it go to deal with the pain and healing that is coming my way. Just like my life, the flow of tragedy and serenity is dynamic, and I can live with those ups and downs. The peace will come on its own without forcing it. To surrender that control, well, that's beauty of this process.

I thought my belief in Christianity was non-negotiable. A few months ago, when I was never more devoted to God, I could not imagine a life without daily prayers and Scripture reading or a death without professing my faith. I was a believer. I believed with all my heart, mind, and soul that Jesus was my hope for salvation. It was my truth, and I was invested in it. I had finished my first Christian-inspired novel, and I was ready to publish it. I had big plans to weave my beliefs into my prospective writing career. I prayed big prayers. Full-faith prayers. I asked for miracles.

In the past three years, my faith abounded and matured. I clung to God with everything I had, because I was aware that I was changing. I was pulling away from fear, anger, and anxiety. I was softening and transforming. I was becoming a different person, just as Jesus advertised if we put our faith in him.

The answered prayers, the beginnings of a new life, finding a purpose and salvation--this had to be evidence that this Christian *stuff* was the absolute truth, right? How could I ever let that truth go?

I was learning what love really was, but the God I knew and the God of the Bible were not the same entity. The catalyst that opened me up to the awakening was soon followed by a period of questioning what I knew about love, the world, and my identity. Everything I believed about life was challenged. It was only inevitable that Christianity was questioned as well.

I took the plunge thoroughly examining key passages of the Bible, spending days (and weeks) on a single passage. I was desperate for the truth that I knew in my heart all along--a loving God would never, ever dream of separating his children. The more I researched, the angrier I became. Next to my desk was a heaping pile of lies. On the other side was a very small pile of truths.

I went from Evangelical to Progressive, from Progressive to simply, follower of Jesus. I was confused, restless, and barely sleeping. What exactly was I supposed to have faith in? What truth was I supposed to cling to? I had already disproved the notion of hell in the afterlife, yet Jesus' parables were indicating a separation. And he had repeatedly said that he only came for his Jewish brothers and sisters. Did he mean anything to me at all?

By this time, every label and facet of my identity had been questioned, examined, or altered. I knew my Christian label was being stretched and kneaded into something different, but I had no idea to what end. I would never give up what little I believed in the Lord and Jesus...but how in the world was I supposed to live that kind of faith?

I couldn't take it anymore. I had enough. I was tapping out. I got on my knees and closed my eyes.

"Lord, I don't want to have the right theology anymore. I just want the right heart."

I no longer cared if I was right. I did not care if I had to say, "I don't know" to the big questions. I was done defending contradictions. I wanted to love, like Jesus. I wanted to have compassion, like Jesus. I wanted to accept all of humanity, like Jesus. I never wanted to create a separation between my brothers and sisters, like Jesus.

How could God refuse my request for this gift and give me a snake or scorpion instead? I had faith enough that this prayer would be answered. I knew it would be.

It had to be.

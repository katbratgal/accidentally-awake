I had a feeling it would happen, and it has. When my life started to transform, I knew I would have a new identity and a fresh start. But I clung so tightly and so desperately to being known as Kelly Marie Gal that I could never imagine being known by anything different.

I could have chosen something spiritual or beautiful for this milestone in my life, but that wouldn't be me. Instead, I gave myself a Western name. A very unisex (ok, overt masculine) name that is so perfectly me.

Gone is Marie, a name I've always tolerated. Maybe even hated.

Gone is my married name, though I am not divorcing. Just giving myself my own independent identity.

And in the publishing world, which I hope to break into shortly, this new middle name is going to sell a lot more books than...*Marie*.

You know those moments when you feel like you're at home with yourself? Those times where things feel so perfect, so right? Like this is where you are supposed to be?

This is one of those times.

Goodbye, Kelly Marie Gal...

And hello, Kelly Michael Gray.

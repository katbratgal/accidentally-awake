I almost didn't write this post. I actually wrote a message similar on November 9 at four in the morning. But I didn't publish it. I hesitated. My message wouldn't have brought unity to my country; it would have added to the fracturing that has became more apparent with this U.S. presidential election. I would have been outed for the "godless" liberal I am, and I was pretty adamant about keeping politics out of this blog and other upcoming projects. After so many reports of bigoted remarks of racism, sexism, and homophobia, I'm changing my rules. I stand for love and acceptance. When others harass, mock, and threaten those who cannot help being who they are, then I am not taking a political stand in saying hatred won the U.S. presidential election. I'm taking a moral stance.

Yes, hatred won, but it won the battle, not the war. The United States of America was a scabbed-over wound that kept getting picked at until an unlikely candidate tore the scab right off. It's bleeding, but through the blood we are seeing the wound for what it is. We can heal it. With time, nurturing, bandages, and rehabilitation, we will learn how to fix it once and for all.

I'm just so fucking sorry that the people that have been hurting for a long time will be the ones to feel the pain of an open wound first.

America has taught every generation wrong. They tell us pain is a *bad* thing. No. Pain is good. Pain, anger, and fear are all good, because those emotions inspire us to do better. When I faced my pain, anger, and fear, I woke up. When we, as a country, face our past, recognize our problems, and admit to our hatred, we will wake up.

I'm counting on the results of this election being the divine plan all along. That is all I can hope for right now.

It's 4 A.M. and I just woke from a dream of watching a graph of the U.S. dollar sink violently low and bombs were echoing around my neighbor. Last night, I watched a swath of red blood stain a map of the United States then woke up to the news of the U.S. Presidential Election. Donald J. Trump did not win. Neither did Hillary Clinton. No, the victory goes to fear.

I'll be the weird one to say, I like fear. Fear is a good, strong emotion. Fear lays it all out. Fear forces me to look at myself and says, "You don't like what's going on? Then, what are you going to do about it?" Fear is a motivator. Fear has an awesome sidekick called anger. Fear and anger can do great things together.

As long as you can recognize them, reign them in, and direct them in paths that lead to justice.

But I'm not that optimistic about the flavor of fear that won the presidential election. Over here, in the U.S., we are taught to fear fear. We are taught that fear is bad. We are told to get over our fears as quickly as possible. In this country, we're not so willing to try to tame fear. We bury fear with alcohol, drugs, and addictions to social media. We shove screens in our faces to drown out the little voices that remind us how afraid we really are. We load up on sugar, chase highs, watch dramas, and do everything we can to silence our fear without ever facing it.

We try to ignore fear and stuff it in the closet, but it has its ways of making itself known. It snaps at people who are checking us out in the grocery store. It makes us cling onto relationships that are toxic to us. We ignore taking responsibility for our own quality of life. It's someone else's fault for why I am the way I am. It distorts the perception of what are in control of and what we are not. That is why many of us medicated for anxiety. It's comes out in violent ways, from road rage to abuse to promising civil unrest if the other candidate becomes president.

I'm not afraid of this new presidenital elect, but I am deeply saddened by the sentiment expressed by the vote. Muslims were told they have to watch their backs in the land of the free. Mexicans were told they are savages and should be locked out. The LGBTQIA were told, yet again, all of their problems are in their head. Blacks got the message that they are nothing more than target practice. Non-christians were told to open their mouths a little wider, so more of Jesus' love can be shoved down their throats. Again, women are told that they most valuable asset is in between their legs. The people who have lived in legitimate fear for their lives and clamoring for the pursuit of happiness were told that they were outsiders and there is no love for them.

The only thing that mattered was soothing the unchecked fear of a collective terrified of the changes on the horizon.

If I hadn't had woken up, I too would have voted fear into office. I used to be terrified of fear. I was mortified of who I was deep down inside. I was plagued by the messages of my faith tradition that if I wasn't a certain way, I would be kindling for hellfire's vicious feast. I grew up confusing fear and love, not understanding that the two could be spearated.

The catalyst to my awakening was seeing what fear did when those I loved chose not to face it and turn into something productive. I saw it for the selfish, hateful, controlling monster it was. I recognized that ugly monster in myself. I couldn't run from it, I couldn't bury it. I couldn't ignore it. The only thing I could do was accept it. I took it on, welcomed it, and told it it could stay. When I had the ability in myself to take away its power and allow it into my life, I realized who the true master was. I could work through it, shape it, delve deeper into it, and direct it into creative projects.

But when fear is left unbridled, it possesses. It lies. It forces us to succumb to paranoia and live with mis-placed faith in instutions. It molds us into control freaks. It tells us other people with other ideas are a threat to our existence if they are given power.

From the post, it's pretty obvious I am on the left-side of the political spectrum in America. I'm not ignorant that this wild fear isn't found on both sides, nor do I condemn the right side. Both sides are desparately needed to balance out power and offer resistence. There are many on both sides not happy with the results. Why I write now has nothing to do with conservative policy and has everything to do with the lack of policy presented. Oversimplistic solutions that harmed others were presented to ease the burns of the fear raging with in us. Desparate for any kind of relief, we scrambled for it, hoping it would healing us without us having to needle our wounds ourselves.

Now, we've found ourselves in a mess--a historic mess--that needs to be sorted out. Fear got the best of us. Fear prevailed.

How do we get out? I have hope that we will climb out of this hole. We will wake up. We will see the fear for what it is. All sides of the political spectrum will deal with their fear. We will face the pain. Because now, we have no choice.

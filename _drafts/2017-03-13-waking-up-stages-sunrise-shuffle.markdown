Life is good! Well, unless you're healing from your past. Then, life could be awful. It feels like you are riding an emotional roller coaster at this point. But you are starting to pull away from words such as *good* and *bad*, so life is more about being than giving it a label. Just as you're getting a hang of waking up, you realize what ego is and how much it is still in charge. You're caught in a confusing mess of empowerment, ego loss, ego traps, and a haunting feeling that your awakening was all bullshit.

While you're grateful for this experience, it won't always feel that way as big issues bubble and boil within you, demanding your attention. You're rehabilitating yourself but having to deal with the world's shit. You're half-awake, stumbling to the coffeemaker, going forward and trusting the process (because there is no where else to go). Your gait is unsteady. You're learning how to walk in two worlds simultaneously.

*Not everyone goes through stages or these stages in this order. Some may not find the process divided into steps. And others may skip stages. Waking up is personal and unique. These stages are about what I went through, and how I coped. Many symptoms and emotions eclipsed several stages, and I am generally speaking of when such events began. Symptoms may have started or will start at different stages for you. The transition between stages can be gentle and prolonged or can be sudden and remarkable.*

### What life is like

If you haven't figured out that you are in an awakening, you'll know by now. You're seeing the paradoxes of life, how the awakening has changed everything and nothing at the same time. Phases of peace come stronger and stay longer. They can become [addicting](/2016-10/paradise-lost). Learning how to ride the ups and downs of this awakening stage is important to ultimately surrendering to the process.

As a result of your identity crisis, you barely recognize yourself. You expect less out of life (and maybe, nothing at all). Dreams you longed to come true don't seem as important anymore. You're becoming more fearless in making decisions and trying new experiences. You don't sweat the small things.

If you were religious before, you may not be now. You're looking inward more and do not need someone else to set your path. You may be seeing morality in a new light. Words like good, bad, sin, evil, and righteous are falling from your vocabulary because you don't see behaviors and people in those shades any longer. You see choices made. And that is all. There is no more need to label them with a modifier.

Your perspective has changed and that will reflect in your language. You may find it incredibly harder to connect to others, and the sting of loneliness will be apparent. You feel like you're living in two worlds, and that is a common complaint during this stage.

You have a new sleep schedule, and the majority of the deliberating fatigue has passed. With new energy comes new ambitions. A new life path is unfolding in front of you. You begin to live a new truth. You might start adopting spiritual practices into your life. If you don't, that's just fine, too. But, I do encourage you to seek some kind of practice, community, or teacher that helps you manage your truths and keeps you grounded.

### Prominent feelings and emotions

* empowerment

* peace

* frustration

* despair

### Symptoms

* Self-awareness: Now, you have an idea of why you behave the way you do, what your fears are, and what you need to do to protect yourself. The deeper you look into yourself, the more painful emotions of shame, pity, and fear will surface. Understanding how you judge yourself is a critical part of self-awareness. Are you more forgiving with your mistakes? Are you less ashamed of personality quirks? Do you believe you are neither superior or inferior to your brothers and sisters of this world? You are focusing on treating self with the love it is worthy of, and acceptance comes from processing these questions.

* Hot flashes and tingling: Feel like you are going to suddenly combust? Does everything tingle? These new sensations may come on strongly for a while, then subside depending on your unique process.

* A strong need to get away from it all: Nature is more than pretty scenery; it's a source of renewal for your energy. You crave its company. As you begin to notice life in all things, you'll feel a greater connection to Earth.

* Food aversions: Your diet will probably change either temporarily or permanently. You may lose an appetite for junk and prepackaged foods. Certain foods may repulse you completely. Some people may adopt a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle at this point. Excess sugar, salt, caffeine, and alcohol might make you feel worse than the effects of consuming them before. Symptoms of aversion might subside after this stage, and you can eat these foods in moderation again.

### Self-care during this stage

Connecting to your spirituality (however it works for you) helps with the frustration of living in two worlds. This could be in the form of meditation, connecting with a spiritual community of other awakened souls, journaling, finding a quiet place to breathe, or getting close to nature. Being kind to yourself is important as you are moving past a place of self-condemning. It does take conscious actions, sometimes, to heal and love yourself. Center yourself; do not to let the world suck you in with its worries and problems.

Give yourself permission to feel things you'd rather not feel. One of the best milestones of this stage is getting past the mindset that happiness is good and sadness is bad. Stages of pain will pass. Stages of bliss will come back. Enjoy the roller coaster, with its ups and downs. It's an experience. And it's all beautiful and perfect.

### Stuck in this awkward shuffle of living in two worlds?

The feeling may not go away. You learn to manage. Living with a broader perspective barely makes a dent in the world around you, and life will continue its course. It's up to you to figure out how you want to proceed with this knowledge and perspective you have gained.

Symptoms of the awakening will cycle over and over as you experience more events. You have a choice to make, as you always have had a choice. You could ignore this experience, fight it, and escape it. You could even lose yourself in the search of remaining in an enlightened state while grasping for that ever-elusive ego death. Or you could surrender. And just be--whatever it is that you need to be.

Now, you might be thinking, "Yes! This is it! We're one stage away from the end of this process!"

And I will tell you...

The end is a lie.

For the next post, I'm changing up the point of view, and I'll be explaining what the *end* of this process means for me. I, too, wanted there to be an end to these strange symptoms, some kind of reward of bliss and knowledge to avoid having to actually *live*.

The end...

That moment when you're sipping a cup of coffee...

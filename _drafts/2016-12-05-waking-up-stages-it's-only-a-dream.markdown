Before you wake up, you need to be asleep. Though not exactly [a step in the awakening process](/2016-11/waking-up), the pre-awakening phase is the suspension of consciousness, the state of dreaming of a better life before the sounding of the alarm clock.

*Not everyone goes through stages or these stages in this order. Some may not find the process divided into steps. And others may skip stages. Waking up is personal and unique. These stages are about what I went through, and how I coped. Many symptoms and emotions eclipsed several stages, and I am generally speaking of when such events began. Symptoms may have started or will start at different stages for you. The transition between stages can be gentle and prolonged or can be sudden and remarkable.*

### What life is like

Just like every awakening is unique, life in the pre-awakened state is different for everyone. Typically, the quality of life is worse than it is after waking up (exceptions being that awakening symptoms can lead someone into addiction or the person develops symptoms of mental illness). The unconscious person has their focus set on short-sighted goals--getting immediate and future desires met. Motivation to complete these goals often deal with preserving image and creating an identity. The unconscious pursues material items, fleeting joys, and escapes that numb pain. The pre-awakened is doing whatever they need to do to shut down anyone and anything (including the voice in their head) from telling them something is wrong in their life and it needs to be faced.

These people might have a specific role they covet in dysfunctional relationships. They may strongly identify with their part and are terrified of stepping out of it. They are also worried about everything in life, from things big and small. They are terrified of death and what lies beyond. Some have established faith in a belief system that promises either eternal reward or punishment after death. They may draw lines between who is acceptable in their life and who is not. Even those not bound by dogma might also have negatively bigoted mindsets and will think humanity is separated by race, nationality, gender, sex, sexuality, class, age, and whatever prejudiced lines they draw. They might not see humanity (and whatever deities they believe in) as equal and one.

Not everyone may be in this much pain before an awakening, but they may have trouble identifying what in their life is driven by ego. They might still believe in the duality of good versus evil, and may not question in depth the moral code they were brought up to believe in. Good deeds might still be done out of the obligation to "do right" and not so much as for the love of another human.

This stage is spent dreaming of a better life and wrestling with feelings of there being "something more."

### Prominent feelings and emotions

- numbness

- depression

- anxiety

- anger/rage

- short-lived happiness

### Symptoms

- Mental anguish: It's easy to feel trapped in a state of helplessness for those who believe this life is all there is. There is little motivation to make significant life changes. There is a strong emphasis on pursuing things that are supposed to bring happiness, but in the end, those things are empty and unfulfilling. Without knowing what love truly is, the pre-awake may seek out toxic and abusive relationships which further destroy their self-esteem.

- Addiction: Whether it's drugs or alcohol, spending every waking moment in front of a screen, overeating, indulging in too much sex, getting lost in books, or an obsession with work and other hobbies, addiction is the hallmark of pre-awakening. The unconscious has to do everything possible to avoid healing past hurts and listening to their intuition, and will embrace people and activities that reinforce their belief that they are unloved, shameful, and worthless.

- Strong prejudices: Instead of noticing how we humans are all the same, the pre-awake are concerned with what makes all of us different. They may be apathetic and overly condemning of different cultures, lifestyles, and behaviors. They may freely hate others and invalidate others' experiences.

### Self-care during this stage

If the person has enough self-awareness that they are inhibiting their growth, they should seek out therapy, rehabilitation, better relationships, and start a commitment to loving themselves. Not everyone wakes up in this lifetime, but that doesn't mean that everyone is stuck in pain and helplessness while asleep. Some find ways to make their experiences tolerable. Sometimes, going down the path of healing leads to an awakening.

### Stuck in the pre-awakening stage?

Forcing an awakening to happen may not be possible. Waking up tends to happen when it happens, when you are meeting milestones in your life. Once you do wake up, you'll see the purpose of each event in your life and how it plays into your transition to consciousness. Awakenings can come (sort-of) quietly and are easy to handle. Then, there are those that come with an obnoxiously loud beeping. And that is the next stage we will talk about next, the alarm that forces you to wake up--[the catalyst](/2017-01/waking-up-stages-beep-beep-beep).

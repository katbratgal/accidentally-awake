I quit. I quit this blog. I quit being a writer. I quit making new friends. I quite being a mom, and I quit my marriage. I quit being human. My life is too perfect. My other blogs are raking enough cash for me to buy the country home of my dreams. I just got a movie deal with my bestselling novels. My many friends are supportive of me, and in return, I lavish them with gifts and help with whatever they need.

I'm not going to lie. I bit off more than I can chew writing a post for each of awakening stages. I probably would have gotten through it quicker had I not done it through the busiest times of the year for me and my family. But it's done! Now, I have unlimited possibilities on the direction I could take this blog, and I can't wait to write about them all.

Since waking up three years ago, so much has changed in my life, and I could spend years talking about each evolution if it helps validate someone else who has gone through the same process.

What can I write about?
